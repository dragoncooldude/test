I know that being apart from you can be hard, and there are times when I miss you so much it feels like a physical ache. But I want you to know that no matter how far apart we are, my love for you is always strong and constant.

Remember all the little moments we've shared together? Like our first date, or the way you curl up into to me on the bed when we're watching a movie and i put my arm around you. Our first kiss, boy was that funny and so sweet. We have made so many memories over the last decade, i wish there was a way to get into our brains and extract it as a video. 
Those are the moments that make me realize just how much you mean to me.

I know that distance can be tough, but I want you to know that I'm always here for you and thinking of you. I am counting down the days until we can be together again. 
I hate everything about this time, but my love for you is bigger than this. Every moment we're apart just makes me appreciate and cherish the time we have together even more. You are my rock, my sunshine, and the love of my life. I can't wait until we're reunited again and can hold each other close.

Love,

Idiot

      Dear Neelu,

There are moments when I am at a loss for words, That's why I wanted to write this letter to you â€“ to let you know that even when I don't have the words, my love for you is always strong.

Since i don't have words, I will write about the memories where we didn't need words to express our feelings.

That rainy day in the auto, me keeping that big plastic sheet for your portfolio. All our Holi celebrations together and our signature pose. Me randomly putting my arms around you on your terrace, and holding your hands.
The time we watched some shows together, And how in the middle we'd start kissing out of nowhere. When you used to kiss me while closing my eyes with your hand. How we used to just lie down hugging for some time.
all those forehead kisses. You showing me your favourite things, from arshi to BTS. You not liking sarabhai vs sarabhai. our mirror selfies. The way you blush at times, hide your face and then outright deny blushing.
The one time we went out and i didn't feel right and drank all your coldrink. You still haven't paid me back for your back exam fees even after making 2 lacs a month(chindi). 

The moment i came from kochi to surprise you and you cried. And you couldn't figure out why and from where times of our lives is being played. The way we hug and bobble. The times we have kissed against that wall. the times i'd slap and say "sexy ass".
the times alien was watching shows with us and we kissed quietly. The time you put all the photos in my bedroom for my birthday. and how i kept that birthday hat on for so long.
I still sometimes see confetti coming out of my laptop from that birthday. 
Our first date, I was thinking if i can hold your hand in public and you did it first. We drove around in my car for long while your hand was over mine. 

I wish we could just live those days again, this time knowing how special those moments are going to be for us. I guess we just have to make some more like that. 
Please know even though i don't have words right now, I still have all my love to give to you. 

Be Mine.

Love,

      Hi sweetestheart, 


I know that you may be going through a difficult time right now and feeling like you are all alone, but there's no chance in hell I'm leaving your side. 


I also know it's been a while since you've been able to feel the love i have for you, so i just wanted to remind you that you are the love of my life, everything i have, and everything i am, will one day be yours, forever.


I can't wait to be with you, to tease you, to call you pappu again on the road, to talk to you while i hold your hands, and my arms are around you. Can't wait to watch things with you, listen to songs you like, hear you complain about Punjabi. 
I can't wait to kiss your lips, lick your boobs, run my hands all over your body, go on our next date, drive with your hand over mine. Give all of my love to you. God i have so much and you deserve all of it. 


You may not be able to reciprocate that love right now, you might not even be able to see things clearly to know that it's there, but i assure you, it is. 


You are hot and smart, almost as much as me, which makes you the luckiest woman on planet, but also i get to spend my life with someone who can match me, so I'm even luckier than you. 


Just remember, doesn't matter where you are and what you're doing, you'll always have a home in me. 


Until next time, our wall awaits.

I know things are difficult and you don't seem to be able to function properly right now. Today was hard, maybe tomorrow will be harder, but whatever goes up, must come down. So will that hard part. It will get easier over time, things will happen. I have complete faith in you. 


It's okay if you couldn't do anything today, it'll be fine if you're not able to tomorrow as well. Take your time, there's no rush. I know once you get into that zone, no one will be able to catch you again. And i also know its just a matter of time now.
